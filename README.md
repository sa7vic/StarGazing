# 🌌 Space Projects Collection

A collection of **4 interactive space-themed projects** built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
Each project explores a different aspect of space: physics, orbital mechanics, pathfinding, and visuals.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. 🌙 Lunar Lander — Autopilot Challenge

A physics-based **lunar lander simulation** where you can manually control the spacecraft or let the **autopilot AI** attempt a landing.

* Manual controls with limited fuel.
* Autopilot toggle (`A`).
* Reset (`R`) and screenshots (`S`).

---

### 2. 🚗🔭 Mars Rover Pathfinder

A **pathfinding visualization** inspired by rovers navigating the Martian surface.

* Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path.
* Interactive wall placement with mouse clicks.
* Run algorithm with `Space`, reset with `R`.

---

### 3. 🌍🚀➡️🪐 Hohmann Transfer to Mars

An **orbital mechanics simulator** showing how to reach Mars from Earth using a Hohmann transfer orbit.

* Adjust **burn velocity** and **launch angle**.
* Animated Sun, Earth, Mars, and spacecraft.
* Detects when transfer succeeds.

---

### 4. ✨ Warp-Speed Starfield

A **sci-fi warp effect** starfield.

* Adjustable **speed** and **star count**.
* Toggle trails (`H`).
* Hyperspace flash button.
* Save screenshots (`S`).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **p5.js** for rendering & interactions
* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
* No frameworks or build tools required

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sa7vic/StarGazing
   cd StarGazing
   ```
2. Open any project folder (`Lunar Lander`, `Mars Rover Pathfinder`, `Orbital Trasfer Simulation`, `Warp-Speed Starfield Jam`).
3. Launch `index.html` in your browser.
