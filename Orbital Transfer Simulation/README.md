# 🌍🚀➡️🪐 Hohmann Transfer: Earth to Mars

An interactive orbital mechanics simulation demonstrating a **Hohmann transfer orbit** from Earth to Mars.
Adjust your spacecraft’s **burn velocity** and **launch angle**, then start the transfer to see if you can intercept Mars’ orbit!

---

## 🎮 Features

* Simplified 2D orbital mechanics with gravity.
* Adjustable **burn velocity** (initial impulse).
* Adjustable **launch angle**.
* Animated Sun, Earth, Mars, and spacecraft.
* Success detection when the spacecraft intersects Mars’ orbit.
